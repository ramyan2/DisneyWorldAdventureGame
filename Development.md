Fixes to make based on feedback:
* Add more vertical space between variables and methods
* Make sure variable names are nounds
* Use more helper methods
* Check if JSON is formatted properly
* Test for bad and null URL

Outline for the plan of changes for this assignment:
* First I must extend my game so that it can take either a filename or a URL and load the JSON from that.
* This should be done as an argument on the command line
* Then work on extending the game engine by incorporating hidden rooms which can only be accessed if one has possession of a special item(golden key)
* To acquire this golden key the user has to solve a riddle or answer a question, once they do so they can access hidden rooms that get you to the end of the game much faster

Process:
* Wrote my JSON file and encountered some formatting issues but fixed them.
